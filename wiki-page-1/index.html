            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also canopy disengagement, canopy shyness,
            or inter-crown spacing) is a feature observed in some tree species,
            in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each 
            other, instead forming a canopy with channel-like gaps. This is 
            most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs 
            between trees of different species. There exist many hypotheses as
            to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research 
            suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect 
            larvae.

        <h3>Possible physiological explanations</h3>

        <p>
            The exact physiological basis of <b>crown shyness is uncertain.</b> 
            It has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s. 
            The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest 
            that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an 
            example of convergent evolution.[citation needed]

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
            leads to <b>"reciprocal pruning"</b> of adjacent trees. Trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during 
            winds. The abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response.
            Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced
            by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion. If the 
            crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, 
            they gradually fill the canopy gaps. This explains instances 
            of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents
            of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions
            conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of 
            flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are 
            flexible and limited in lateral movement. According to 
            this theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches greatly 
            influences the degree of crown shyness.
