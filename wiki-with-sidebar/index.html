                <h1>God Of War (PS2)</h1>
                <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Kratos is a Spartan warrior with superhuman godly-powers and
                    abilities (due to the fact that he is the demigod son of
                    Zeus the King of the Gods, which was never revealed in the 
                    first game until in the sequel) who serves the Gods of 
                    Olympus in Greece. Numerous flashbacks revealed that he was 
                    once a successful warrior but eventually became a 
                    bloodthirsty captain in the Spartan Army as he frequently 
                    led his men into several victories before being defeated by 
                    a Barbarian King, Alrik, Kratos' arch-enemy. Facing death, 
                    but refuse to surrender his defeat, Kratos called on the God
                    of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the God would 
                    spare his men and provide the power to destroy their 
                    enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair
                    of chained blades forged in the depths of Tartarus, to his
                    new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then 
                    decapitated the Alrik while Ares destroys Alrik's men, 
                    leading Kratos to regain his victory once more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading 
                    an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena, the
                    Goddess of Wisdom. Unbeknownst to Kratos, Ares had secretly
                    transported Kratos' wife and daughter to the village; 
                    during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos 
                    accidentally killed them in a blind fury. Although Ares 
                    believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect 
                    warrior, the horrified and saddened Spartan instead 
                    renounced his pledge of servitude to the God and swore 
                    vengeance against him. An elderly Oracle of the destroyed 
                    village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead 
                    family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the
                    nickname, "Ghost of Sparta". Plagued by nightmares of his 
                    horrible deed, Kratos vowed to serve the other Gods in hope
                    of ridding himself of the visions.

                <p>
                    The gameplay of God of War focuses on combo-based combat, 
                    achieved through the player's main weaponâ€”the Blades of 
                    Chaos and a secondary weapon acquired later in the game. It 
                    features quick time events that require the player to 
                    complete various game controller actions in a timed sequence
                    to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up
                    to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as 
                    alternative combat options. It also features puzzles and 
                    platforming elements.

                    Spartan warrior and demigod with an incredible set of 
                    superhuman godly powers due to his blood divine heritage of 
                    a God, who swears revenge against Ares for betraying him and
                    for making him turn his Baldes of Chaos on his wife and 
                    daughter. After exacting revenge against Ares at the end of 
                    the game, Kratos succeeded him by becoming the new God of
                    War (which the first game explains that Kratos is the 
                    titular character of the series, not Ares).
